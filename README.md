For this project, I worked as a security professional for a healthcare company. I was required to regularly update a file that identified the employees who could access restricted content. There was an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the companyâ€™s restricted subnetwork. Also, there was a remove list that identified which employees I needed to remove from the allow list. My task was to create an algorithm that used Python code to check whether the allow list contained any IP addresses identified on the remove list.
